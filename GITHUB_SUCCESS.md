## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Database for Production

Your app currently uses SQLite, which **resets on Vercel** (serverless limitation).

### For Production: Use PostgreSQL

#### Option 1: Vercel Postgres (Easiest)
1. In Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → **Storage**
2. Click **"Create Database"** → Choose **"Postgres"**
3. Copy connection string
4. Add to **Environment Variables:**
   - Name: `DATABASE_URL`
   - Value: (paste connection string)

#### Option 2: Supabase (Free)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Create new project
3. Get connection string from Settings → Database
4. Add to Vercel environment variables

#### Update Your Code:
Add this to `app_auth.py` around line 15:

```python
import os
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL') or 'sqlite:///loaneasy.db'
```

Then push:
```powershell
git add app_auth.py
git commit -m "Add PostgreSQL support for production"
git push origin main
```

## 🔐 Secure Your App

### Generate Secret Key:
```powershell
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

### Add to Vercel:
1. Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `SECRET_KEY` = (your generated key)

### Update Code:
```python
# In app_auth.py line 14:
import os
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') or 'loaneasy-secret-key-2025-secure'
```
