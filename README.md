## 🎯 How to Use the Web App

1. Fill in all applicant information:
   - Income details
   - Loan amount and term
   - Personal information
   - Credit history
   
2. Click "Check Eligibility"

3. Get instant prediction:
   - ✅ **Approved**: Green success message with confidence %
   - ❌ **Not Approved**: Red rejection message with suggestions

## 🔧 Customization

### Modify Training Data
Edit `generate_data.py` to adjust:
- Number of samples
- Feature distributions
- Approval logic rules

### Tune Models
In `train_model.py`, adjust:
- `max_depth` for Decision Tree
- `n_estimators` for Random Forest
- `kernel` for SVM

### Customize UI
Edit templates in `templates/` folder:
- `index.html` - Main prediction interface
- `about.html` - Information page

## 📊 Understanding Predictions

The model considers:
1. **Credit History** (Most Important) - Good credit significantly increases approval chances
2. **Income-to-Loan Ratio** - Higher income relative to loan amount is favorable
3. **Total Household Income** - Combined applicant and co-applicant income
4. **Education Level** - Graduates have slightly higher approval rates
5. **Property Location** - Urban properties may have different criteria

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Model Not Loading
```powershell
# Run these commands in order:
python generate_data.py
python train_model.py
python app.py
```

### Port Already in Use
```powershell
# Change port in app.py:
app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
```

### Missing Dependencies
